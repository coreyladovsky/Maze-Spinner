## MVP
Navigate a randomly rotating maze while racing against a computer player or clock.
1. Attractive navigable maze
2. User controlled movable piece
3. Random 90 degree rotations.
4. Clock/ Timer
5. Computer player
6. Multiple levels

## Technologies
I will be using JavaScript, Canvas, HTML, and CSS
I believe learning canvas to make the maze could prove to be difficult.
I am also unsure how I will get the maze to randomly rotate and how to keep the movement smooth.
I plan to solve these problems by scouring the internet for people whom have had similar problems as myself.

## Implementation Timeline
Day 1: Study canvas and have a maze on the screen. Get a square to move through it.
Day 2: Implement screen rotation and clock. Make a Starting Page and game over page.
Day 3: Add a computer player that follows a mirrored symmetric maze. Add music.
